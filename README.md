This is the official repository of our [USENIX Security 2024](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24) paper "[KnowPhish: Large Language Models Meet Multimodal Knowledge Graphs for Enhancing Reference-Based Phishing Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02253)".

## Updates
- [2024.11] We released the download link for the TR-OP dataset.
- [2024.08] Thank you for your interest in our KnowPhish project! We would like to let you know that our phishing detection solution is currently deployed in a commercial setting. Due to security considerations from our sponsors, we are unable to release the code or data at this time. As such, this GitHub repository serves as a host for the supplementary materials PDF. That said, I am more than happy to answer any questions you may have regarding our paper and its findings. Please feel free to reach out via email or raise an issue here. We will keep you informed if there are any updates on the potential codes or data releases in the future. Thank you again for your attention!
