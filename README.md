This is the official repository of our [USENIX Security 2024](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24) paper "[KnowPhish: Large Language Models Meet Multimodal Knowledge Graphs for Enhancing Reference-Based Phishing Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02253)".

## Updates
- [2024.11] We released the download link for the TR-OP dataset.


## Datasets
1. [TR-OP](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/z1liysgw42g9apcsp1v3i/TR-OP.zip?rlkey=9ovjwzteon3gp6v1yff1pdjrt&st=ftefbkof&dl=0): A balanced evaluation dataset with 5000 benign webpages and 5000 phishing webpages.

## Codes
Thanks for your interest in our KnowPhish project! Our phishing detector is currently deployed in a commercial setting. Due to security considerations from our sponsors, we are unable to release the code or knowledge base at this time. As such, this GitHub repository serves as a host for the supplementary materials PDF and certain datasets. That said, I am more than happy to answer any questions you may have regarding our paper and its findings. Please feel free to reach out via email or raise an issue here. Thank you again for your attention!
